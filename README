It is unclear to us whether or not our parser is supposed to handle
sequence commands with a single simple command, such as "a;". If so, it is not
clear how to setup a command struct with it.

Redirection cases are simply handled as a single simple word, since the only mention
of redirection in the command struct is the buffers for the command input, and output
which we have not received by this part of the project.

These issues will resolve themselves with further clarification from the TA and more
test case examples.


Stuff that doesn't work:

Executing a subshell command, seg fault when accessing command->u.subshell_command
Was hoping to make sure (-- && --) && (-- || --) works!
